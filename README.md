# WWW2025_MMCTR_Challenge
# CTR Prediction Project

## 📌 Overview
This project focuses on **Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction**, using data analysis and machine learning techniques to estimate the probability that a user will click on an item (e.g., an ad or recommendation).

The main work is contained in the Jupyter Notebook:

- **Hana_Othmane_ctr.ipynb**

## 📂 Project Structure

## 🚀 Features
- Data loading and preprocessing  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Feature engineering  
- Model training and evaluation  
- Performance metrics for CTR prediction  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python 3  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- pandas  
- numpy  
- matplotlib / seaborn  
- scikit-learn  

## ▶️ How to Run
1. Clone or download the repository
2. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
   ```
3. Open the notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Hana_Othmane_ctr.ipynb
   ```
4. Run the cells sequentially

## 📊 Results
The notebook evaluates CTR prediction performance using standard machine learning metrics.

## 📌 Notes
